# The Collective Project

A helicopter collective control for use with flight simulators.

## Intro

I like to fly flight sims. I like flying helicopters. I like to fly in VR. For this reason I wanted a collective control with plenty of buttons and switches that I could map to cockpit controls so they were convenient and easy to operate in VR. Fixed wing guys typically have a HOTAS throttle with a whole load of controls, and this was to be the heli equivalent. I also wanted a twist throttle. To be honest there is not much use for a twist throttle on modern helicopters unless you like going through the whole startup procedure, but on some of the early birds it was as much a part of flying as the cyclic and pedals.

Oh, and I'm not made of money and can't afford to dish out hundreds of dollars on fancy commercial set-ups. And I like making things. The answer was a no-brainer.
